# flask-mega-tut
Following the flask mega tutorial. Starting at https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

This is just an attempt to learn how flask works (again). The content contained herein is a reproduction of the tutorial.

## Installed packages
For my reference - yes, this could go in the setup.py... but that currently doesn't exist ;-)
- flask
- python-dotenv - makes use of the .flaskenv file, which sets the FLASK_APP variable
